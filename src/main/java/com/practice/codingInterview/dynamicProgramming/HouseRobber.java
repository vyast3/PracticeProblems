 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.

 * stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have
 * security system connected and it will automatically contact the police
 * if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
