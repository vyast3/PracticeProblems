/**
 * Created by vyast3 on 7/5/15.
 * Given an unsorted array of n integers which can contain integers from 1 to n.
 * Some elements can be repeated multiple times and some other elements can be absent from the array.
 * Count frequencies of all elements in array in O(1) extra space and O(n) time
 * Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 3, 2, 5}
 * Output: Below are frequencies of all elements
 * 1 -> 0
 * 2 -> 2
 * 3 -> 2
 * 4 -> 0
 * 5 -> 1
