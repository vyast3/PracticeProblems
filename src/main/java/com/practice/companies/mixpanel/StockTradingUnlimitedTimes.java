 * Imagine you have built a time machine and you write down these numbers at the end of the month,
 * and then jump back in time to the beginning of the month. You are now going to use your time travel
 * powers to make a huge profit on the stock market!
 * <p>
 * Write a function that computes the maximum profit you could make trading on this series of prices.
 * You can buy and sell the stock as many times as you want and there is no fee to buy or sell,
 * but you can only own 1 share of the stock at a time (i.e. you must sell before you can buy again).
