/**
 *
 Compute the value of an expression in Reverse Polish Notation. Supported operators are "+", "-", "*" and "/".
 * Reverse Polish is a postfix mathematical notation in which each operator immediately follows its operands.
 * Each operand may be a number or another expression.
 * For example, 3 + 4 in Reverse Polish is 3 4 + and 2 * (4 + 1) would be written as 4 1 + 2 * or 2 4 1 + *
 *
 * @param  a sequence of numbers and operators, in Reverse Polish Notation
 * @return the result of the computation
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException ops don't represent a well-formed RPN expression
 * @throws ArithmeticException the computation generates an arithmetic error, such as dividing by zero
 *
 * <p>Some sample ops and their results:
 * ["4", "1", "+", "2.5", "*"] -> ((4 + 1) * 2.5) -> 12.5
 * ["5", "80", "40", "/", "+"] -> (5 + (80 / 40)) -> 7
