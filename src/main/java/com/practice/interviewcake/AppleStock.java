/**
 * Problem -
 * I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where:
 * The indices are the time, as a number of minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
 * The values are the price of Apple stock at that time, in dollars.
 * For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.
 * <p/>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and
 * 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday. For this problem, we won't allow "shorting"—you must buy before you sell.
 * <p/>
 * Solution-
 * We walk through the array from beginning to end, keeping track of:
 * our min_price so far
 * our max_profit so far
 * For each time, we check to see if:
 * we have a new min_price, or
 * buying at the current min_price and selling at the current_price would give a new max_profit.\
 * O(n) time (we're only looping through the array once) and O(1) space.
 * <p/>
